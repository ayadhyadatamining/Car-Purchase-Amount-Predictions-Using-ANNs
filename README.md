 Car Purchase Prediction Model

Step 1: Data Collection
Gather the relevant customer data that includes attributes such as customer name, email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, net worth, and the target variable (Car Purchase Amount).
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Check the dataset for missing or incomplete values.
Handle missing values by either filling them with mean/median values or dropping rows/columns with significant missing data.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Encode Categorical Data: If the dataset includes categorical variables (e.g., country, gender), encode them using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into numerical formats.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features (e.g., age, salary, net worth) to ensure they are on the same scale for better model performance.
Step 4: Data Splitting
Split the dataset into two parts: one for training the model and one for testing the model. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Step 5: Model Selection
Choose a suitable model for predicting continuous values (since the target variable is a price). Common models include:
Linear Regression (for simpler relationships)
Decision Trees or Random Forests (for capturing non-linear patterns)
Neural Networks (for more complex relationships)
Step 6: Model Building
Build a machine learning model using your chosen algorithm.
For Neural Networks, use layers like dense layers, activation functions, and an appropriate output layer for regression (typically using linear activation).
Compile the model by selecting a suitable optimizer (e.g., RMSprop or Adam) and a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression tasks).
Step 7: Model Training
Train the model using the training dataset. Monitor the loss and accuracy metrics during training.
If needed, adjust hyperparameters like learning rate or the number of epochs to improve model performance.
Step 8: Model Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using evaluation metrics like:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Step 9: Model Tuning
If the performance of the model is not satisfactory, you can try tuning hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, dropout rate) or try different algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Step 10: Prediction
Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
For each new customer, input their features into the model, and it will predict the car purchase amount.
Step 11: Deployment and Monitoring
If you're deploying the model in a real-world scenario (e.g., a car dealership), make sure to regularly monitor its performance and retrain it with new customer data to keep it updated and accurate.
